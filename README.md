## Firewall
A firewall is a **network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing traffic based on predefined security rules**, acting as a barrier between trusted internal networks and untrusted external networks like the internet.

Firewalls are essential because they:

1. Prevent Unauthorized Access
2. Block Malicious Traffic
3. Protect Sensitive Information
4. Control Network Usage
5. Mitigate Insider Risks

## Firewall V1
In V1 we predifined the IP's that are blocked and other IP's are allowed. If the network was private we would give rules as trust no one and only allow specific IP.
  ```bash
 python3 firewallv1.py
  ```
